Typical problems that we solve with Recipes:

* **Standardizing Configuration Across Multiple Sites:**
  Need to keep dozens of websites consistent? Recipes can automate the setup of identical configurations, ensuring each site operates with the same settings, such as security or SEO configurations.

* **Onboarding New Sites Quickly:**
  Launching new websites with the same features and configuration becomes seamless, reducing the time needed for manual setup and potential human error.

* **Implementing a New Feature with Proven Solutions:**
  When adding a new feature to an existing website, you need a reliable and efficient solution. Recipes can help implement proven configurations, such as a simple CRM, an SEO-optimized blog, commerce payment gateway configuration for PayPal, a knowledge base for an intranet system, or an article content type for a news portal.
